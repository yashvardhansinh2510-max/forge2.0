"""Regression test for a second live production bug found while verifying
the idempotency_key fix: placing an order on a ₹0 quotation (a Selection
promoted to Quotation with nothing priced yet, a free-sample order, etc.)
dead-lettered the OrderPlaced event after 8 retries — permanently stuck,
zero Purchase Orders, zero Payments.

Root cause: `Payment.amount` is `Field(gt=0)`, but `_handle_order_placed`
always tried to build a Payment for `grand_total`, including when that's
0.0. Building `Payment(amount=0.0, ...)` raises a pydantic ValidationError,
which aborts the whole Mongo transaction — rolling back the Purchase Order(s)
inserted earlier in the same transaction too.

A ₹0 order has nothing outstanding to collect, so the fix is to skip
creating a Payment entirely rather than trying to represent "no payment" as
an invalid zero-amount one — matching the product requirement that a ₹0
Selection/Quotation must never appear in Payments.
