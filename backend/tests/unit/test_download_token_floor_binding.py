"""A browser download must stay inside the business unit it was started from.

`?dl=` downloads (quotation PDFs, chalans, .xlsx exports) are plain browser
navigations, so they structurally cannot carry `X-Floor-Id`. That left
`user.active_floor_id` unset on exactly those requests, and for an all-floors
owner/manager an unset active floor makes `floor_query()` unrestricted — so a
download URL resolved against every unit's records rather than the one the user
was working in. It is the only in-product request path where the floor header is
absent by construction.

The floor is now recorded when the token is minted and replayed when it is
consumed, mirroring how `session_id` is already carried through.
