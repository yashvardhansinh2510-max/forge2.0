"""Structural gate: every id-addressed mutation must be floor-scoped.

BuildCon House runs two businesses that must behave as independent companies.
The recurring defect -- six instances found in Phase 0 alone -- is a handler
that takes a record id from the caller and acts on it without checking the
record belongs to the caller's business unit. Reviews keep finding these one
at a time, which does not scale and does not hold: the next new route starts
the cycle again.

So this test enumerates them instead. Any POST/PATCH/PUT/DELETE handler whose
route carries a path parameter must either reference a scoping helper in its
own body, or appear in ALLOWLIST with a written reason.

Adding a new id-addressed mutation without scoping it fails this test.
