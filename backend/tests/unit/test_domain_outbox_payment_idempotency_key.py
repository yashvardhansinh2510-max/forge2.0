"""Regression test for a live production bug: placing a SECOND order ever
(via the OrderPlaced automation) crashed with a Mongo DuplicateKeyError and
rolled back both the Purchase Order(s) AND the Payment for that order.

Root cause: `_handle_order_placed` built its Payment via `Payment(...).dict()`
without ever setting `idempotency_key`, so pydantic's `.dict()` always
included an explicit `"idempotency_key": None` in the upserted document.
`payments.payment_idempotency_key` is a UNIQUE **sparse** index — sparse only
skips documents where the field is entirely ABSENT, not documents where it is
present-but-null. The first automation payment ever inserted therefore
permanently claimed the one legal `null` slot; every subsequent order-placed
payment (which also always carries an explicit null) collided against it and
raised `DuplicateKeyError`, aborting the whole transaction (so the Purchase
Orders inserted earlier in the same transaction were rolled back too) —
matching the reported symptom of "no error shown, no payment, no purchase
order" (the frontend saw a raw connection failure, not a clean 4xx/5xx, once
the transaction/session teardown itself failed).

`idempotency_key` is a real feature used by `POST /api/payments` (client-
supplied dedup key for manual "Record Payment" retries) — automation payments
dedupe via their own `automation_key` field instead, so they must never write
`idempotency_key` at all.
