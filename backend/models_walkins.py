"""Walk-ins — Phase 4 of the Follow-ups 2.0 / CRM redesign (2026-07-30).

Entry point of the whole BuildCon ERP pipeline:
    Walk-in -> Customer -> Selection -> Quotation -> Order -> Dispatch -> Payment

Deliberately department-agnostic: `floor_id` doubles as "Interested
Department" (Floor is already a generic, admin-configurable name+slug
entity — see models.FloorPublic — used today for Ground Floor/Tiles and
First Floor/Sanitary). No new department taxonomy was introduced.
