"""Numbered migration runner.

Forge previously had no versioned migration history — schema changes on live
data happened as ad-hoc one-off scripts in backend/scripts/, with no record
of what had already run against a given database (see
PRODUCTION_FIXES_2026-07-16.md item 4). This gives every future schema
change a single, auditable path:

    backend/migrations/0002_something.py:

        async def up(db):
            await db.some_collection.update_many({"field": {"$exists": False}}, {"$set": {"field": None}})

Rules for writing a migration:
  * Filename: `NNNN_snake_case_description.py`, NNNN zero-padded and strictly
    increasing — the runner applies them in filename order.
  * Must define an async `up(db)`. No `down()` — Forge migrations are
    forward-only (matches the rest of the codebase's style: additive,
    backward-compatible changes rather than destructive rollbacks).
  * Must be idempotent (safe to run twice) — the runner records success in
    `schema_migrations` and will not re-run an applied migration, but idempotency
    is still the safety net if that record is ever lost or hand-edited.
  * Never `DROP`/`delete_many` on a live collection without a reviewed,
    explicit reason in the migration's own docstring.

Usage:
    ./.venv/bin/python scripts/run_migrations.py            # apply all pending
    ./.venv/bin/python scripts/run_migrations.py --dry-run  # list pending only
