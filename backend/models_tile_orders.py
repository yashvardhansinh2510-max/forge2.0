"""Tile Orders logistics — CustomerOrder aggregation + ReadyBatch/Dispatch/
Chalan as first-class collections. Kept separate from models.py (already
740+ lines) and prefixed `Tile` to avoid colliding with the existing
Chalan/ChalanLineItem classes still used by the old embedded system on
PurchaseOrder.chalans (left in place, unread by any code in this module —
see the design doc's Migration section).

TileChalan is immutable once created: no route in routes/tile_orders.py
ever issues a PATCH/PUT against the chalans collection. A correction always
means a new TileDispatch + new TileChalan, never editing an existing one.
