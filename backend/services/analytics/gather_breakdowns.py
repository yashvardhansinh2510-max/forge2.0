"""The only module that reads Mongo for the Sales Data launch breakdowns.

Every read starts from Phase 0's `build_match`, so floor scoping and the
ordered_at-vs-created_at date-field choice live in exactly one place, same as
every other analytics surface.

**No new aggregation pipelines.** Revenue by Brand and Best Selling Products
both go through the canonical `metrics.line_revenue_pipeline`; Revenue by
Customer and Recent Orders fold in Python over a plain `find`, exactly the
convention `gather_collections_orders` already established for
doc-level (rather than line-level) rollups. Confirmed-order volume is small
by construction — one document per closed deal — and folding in Python keeps
these unit-testable against the codebase's existing fake-db pattern.
