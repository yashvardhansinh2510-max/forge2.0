"""Real notification generation.

Before this file existed, db.notifications only ever got rows from the
one-time demo seed (seed.py) — nothing in the running application ever
created one, so the Notifications screen was permanently frozen on
whatever the seed happened to contain. This module is the single write
path for real, in-app notifications going forward.
