## 1. Main Catalog `/catalog`

### Initial Load Performance
- **DOM Ready**: 0.35s ✓ (fast)
- **Network Idle**: 21.19s ⚠️ (SLOW - primary bottleneck)
- **Total API Calls**: 11
- **Product API Calls**: 1

### Initial API Calls (with detailed timing)
```
1. GET /api/auth/me
   - Duration: 53ms
   - Transfer Size: 485 bytes
   - Status: 200 ✓

2. GET /api/categories
   - Duration: 532ms
   - Transfer Size: 1,846 bytes
   - Status: 200 ✓

3. GET /api/brands
   - Duration: 541ms
   - Transfer Size: 706 bytes
   - Status: 200 ✓

4. GET /api/catalog/hierarchy
   - Duration: 2,292ms (2.3s)
   - Transfer Size: 44,070 bytes (44 KB)
   - Status: 200 ✓

5. GET /api/products/families?limit=60
   - Duration: 15,323ms (15.3s) ⚠️ PRIMARY BOTTLENECK
   - Transfer Size: 6,897 bytes (6.9 KB)
   - Status: 200 ✓
```

**🔥 ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: `/api/products/families?limit=60` takes **15.3 seconds** to respond. This is the primary performance bottleneck causing the 21s network idle time.

### Rendering
- **Rendered Cards**: 61 family cards
- **Total Label**: "2,361 families"
- **Content Visible**: Yes, products render correctly with images

### Scrolling Behavior (3 scrolls to bottom)
- **Scroll 1**: 61 cards, 1 product API (no change)
- **Scroll 2**: 61 cards, 1 product API (no change)
- **Scroll 3**: 61 cards, 1 product API (no change)

**⚠️ CRITICAL FINDING**: Infinite scroll is NOT working. Cards remain at 61 despite scrolling to bottom repeatedly. No additional API requests are triggered.

### Does it stop at exactly 60?
**NO** - Stops at 61 cards, not 60.

### Variants Toggle
**NOT FOUND** - No Variants toggle button found in the UI. The catalog appears to show families by default with no option to switch to variants view.

### Console Errors
**TO BE COLLECTED** - Need to analyze console logs.

---

## 2. Quotation Builder `/quotations/new`

### Initial Load
- **Product API Calls**: 3
- **Rendered Product Cards**: 1 ⚠️ (seems broken)
- **UI State**: Shows "All brands - 0 products" with empty product grid

### Product API Details
```
1. GET /api/products (no params visible)
2. GET /api/products (no params visible)
3. GET /api/products?limit=60&skip=0&sort=popular
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL FINDING**: Only 1 product card renders despite 3 API calls. The product grid appears broken or stuck in loading state.

### Scroll Container
**NOT TESTED YET** - Need to identify scroll container and test onEndReached behavior.

### Skip Requests
**NOT OBSERVED** - No skip requests detected during initial load.

---

## 3. Catalog Filters

### Brand Filter (Hansgrohe)
**TESTED** ✓
- **Cards Before Filter**: 61
- **Cards After Filter**: 0 ⚠️
- **New API Calls**: 2

**⚠️ CRITICAL FINDING**: Clicking Hansgrohe brand filter results in 0 cards displayed. This suggests either:
1. The filter is working but no Hansgrohe families are being returned
2. The filter is broken and clearing all results
3. The UI is not rendering the filtered results

### Category Filter
**NOT TESTED** - Could not test category filter after brand filter resulted in 0 cards.

### Search (Exact SKU)
**NOT FOUND** - Search input not found in the catalog UI.

---

## 4. Purchases `/purchases`

### API Behavior
- **Calls /api/products**: NO ✓
- **Calls /api/purchase***: YES (4 calls)

**✓ CONFIRMED**: Purchases page uses denormalized purchase-item snapshots, NOT the catalog.

---

## 5. Images

### Request Counts
- **Initial Viewport**: 0 images tracked
- **After Scroll 1**: 0 images tracked
- **After Scroll 2**: 0 images tracked
- **After Scroll 3**: 0 images tracked
- **Total Images Loaded**: 252 images

**⚠️ NOTE**: Image tracking may be incomplete. Total shows 252 images loaded, but viewport tracking shows 0. This suggests:
1. Images may be loaded via different mechanism (not traditional <img> tags)
2. Images may be using expo-image or React Native Image component
3. Tracking logic needs refinement

### Timing
**NOT MEASURED YET** - Need to collect cold/warm timings and cache behavior.

---

## 6. Browser Performance

### Measured Metrics
**NOT COLLECTED YET** - Need to measure:
- PerformanceObserver long tasks
- performance.memory.usedJSHeapSize
- Scroll FPS
- DOM node count

---

## 7. React Render Timing

**NOT AVAILABLE** - React Profiler not accessible without code changes.

---

## 8. Raw Measurements Summary

### Network Idle Time: 21.19s
This is the PRIMARY performance issue. The catalog page takes over 21 seconds to reach network idle state, despite DOM being ready in 0.35s.

### Infinite Scroll: BROKEN
Scrolling to bottom does not trigger additional product loads. Cards remain at 61.

### Quotation Builder: BROKEN
Only 1 product card renders despite successful API calls.

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Test Variants toggle on catalog
2. ✅ Test Hansgrohe brand filter + category filter
3. ✅ Test search with exact SKU
4. ✅ Collect detailed API response times and sizes
5. ✅ Measure browser performance metrics
6. ✅ Test at tablet viewport (1024x800)
7. ✅ Test at mobile viewport (390x844)
8. ✅ Analyze console errors
9. ✅ Determine root cause of 21s network idle time
10. ✅ Investigate why infinite scroll is not working

---

## Preliminary Conclusions

1. **Catalog loads slowly** (21s to network idle) - this is the main performance bottleneck
2. **Infinite scroll is broken** - no additional products load on scroll
3. **Quotation Builder product grid is broken** - only 1 card renders
4. **Purchases correctly uses denormalized data** - does not call /api/products
5. **Image tracking needs refinement** - current method may not capture all image loads

**This is a READ-ONLY investigation. No fixes will be applied.**
