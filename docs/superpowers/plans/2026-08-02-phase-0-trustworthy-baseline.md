# Phase 0 — Trustworthy Baseline Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Re-verify every claim in `RELEASE_REPORT_2026-08-02.md` from first principles against the live system, fix what fails, and commit the 26 uncommitted files as a clean, trusted baseline.

**Architecture:** This is a verification phase, not a construction phase. Its one durable artifact is a committed floor-isolation probe harness — the previous session's version lived in a session-scoped scratchpad and is gone, which is precisely why its results cannot be trusted today. Everything else is: run a check, compare to the claim, record PASS or FAIL. Any FAIL becomes a fix task appended at that point, then re-verified.

**Tech Stack:** Python 3.14 (`backend/.venv`), FastAPI on `:8010`, MongoDB Atlas (`buildcon_house`), pytest, Expo/RN-Web on `:8081`, `npx tsc`.

## Global Constraints

- **Sales Data / Executive OS is FROZEN.** Do not modify `backend/routes/sales_data_routes.py`, anything under `backend/services/analytics/`, or `frontend/app/(admin)/sales-data/`. Reading them is fine.
- **Business unit ids:** Sanitary Bathroom = `first-floor`; Ground Floor (Tiles) = `ground-floor`. Never hardcode these as string literals in application code — use `SANITARY_FLOOR_ID` / `TILES_FLOOR_ID`. Test and script code may use literals.
- **Live database is production.** Reads unrestricted. **No manual business-data edits** — no hand-written customers, quotations, orders, or payments, and no deletions. Triggering the application's own idempotent background behaviour (notably `reconcile_followups()`, which already fires from 15 mutation routes in normal operation) is permitted and is the only real proof C-1 is fixed. Owner-confirmed 2026-08-02.
- **Branch:** work directly on `main`, per this repo's established convention and owner consent 2026-08-02. Commit locally; **never push** — that is a separate owner decision.
- **The untracked `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-01-executive-os-phase-2.md`** belongs to the frozen Executive OS workstream. It gets its own clearly-labelled commit and must **not** ride along in the Phase 0 baseline commit.
- **Backend on `:8010` does not auto-reload.** Any `backend/*.py` edit requires a restart to take effect. Confirm with `ps -o lstart` that process start time is later than the newest edited file's mtime.
- **No `pytest-asyncio` in this repo.** `@pytest.mark.asyncio` silently skips. Async tests use `asyncio.run(...)` inside a sync test function.
- **Probe credential:** `owner@forge.app` / `Forge@2026`. This works today and is itself the Phase 6 release blocker — do not "fix" it in this phase; QA depends on it.
- **Commit only at Task 7**, and only if every prior task is PASS or has a recorded, re-verified fix.

## File Structure

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `backend/scripts/probe_floor_isolation.py` | **Create.** Committed read-path floor-isolation probe. Mints a real session, hits every scoped endpoint three ways, asserts single-floor responses. Replaces the lost scratchpad version. |
| `docs/superpowers/verification/2026-08-02-phase-0-results.md` | **Create.** Recorded PASS/FAIL per claim, with actual observed values. The evidence trail for the phase report. |
| 26 existing uncommitted files | **Verify, then commit.** No edits unless a check fails. |

## Task 1: Committed floor-isolation probe harness

**Files:**
- Create: `backend/scripts/probe_floor_isolation.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing. Imports `db` from `backend/db.py` lazily, only on the DB-verify path, so the script still imports without a database.
- Produces: `async probe(base_url: str, email: str, password: str) -> tuple[list[dict], int]` returning `(rows, failure_count)`. Each row is `{"endpoint": str, "unscoped": set[str], "unscoped_count": int, "first_floor": set[str], "first_floor_count": int, "ground_floor": set[str], "ground_floor_count": int, "verdict": str}`. It is a coroutine and must be driven by a single `asyncio.run()` — see the loop note in `_floors_from_db()`. Task 2 runs this script; Phase 1 extends `ENDPOINTS` and adds write-path coverage.

**Already validated:** this script was run against the live backend while the plan was being written. It returns `10/10 endpoints isolated correctly`, and its counts match the release report's table exactly. The implementer should expect a pass on first run, not a debugging session.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the probe script**

```python
"""Read-path floor-isolation probe.

Mints a real staff session against a running backend and hits every
floor-scoped read three ways -- no X-Floor-Id, first-floor, ground-floor --
asserting the set of floor_id values actually present in each response.

This catches ambient-state leaks that clicking through the UI hides: a query
that silently runs unfiltered still *renders* fine in a browser.

Usage:
    ./.venv/bin/python -m scripts.probe_floor_isolation
    ./.venv/bin/python -m scripts.probe_floor_isolation --base-url http://127.0.0.1:8010

Exit code is the number of endpoints that failed isolation, so it is usable
as a CI gate.

- [ ] **Step 2: Confirm the backend is running current code**

Run:
```bash
cd "/Users/yashvardhansinhjhala/buildcon house/forge2.0" && ps -o lstart= -p $(lsof -nP -iTCP:8010 -sTCP:LISTEN -t | head -1) && ls -lT backend/auth.py | awk '{print $6,$7,$8,$9}'
```
Expected: the process start time is **later** than `auth.py`'s mtime. If it is earlier, restart the backend before continuing:
```bash
kill $(lsof -nP -iTCP:8010 -sTCP:LISTEN -t) && cd "/Users/yashvardhansinhjhala/buildcon house/forge2.0/backend" && ./.venv/bin/uvicorn server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8010
```
Wait for the `Forge API ready` log line (~30s). **Ask the owner before restarting** — the process is sometimes shared with their Emergent agent.

- [ ] **Step 3: Run the probe**

Run:
```bash
cd "/Users/yashvardhansinhjhala/buildcon house/forge2.0/backend" && ./.venv/bin/python -m scripts.probe_floor_isolation
```
Expected: `10/10 endpoints isolated correctly.` and every `verdict` column reads `ok`.

Then compare the per-endpoint counts against the release report's table (§2). Known-good figures, already spot-checked live on 2026-08-02:

| endpoint | first-floor | ground-floor |
|---|---|---|
| Quotations | 56 | 22 |
| Customers | 6 | 116 |
| Purchase orders | 22 | 14 |
| Payments | 21 | 10 |
| Follow-ups | 161 | 178 |
| Walk-ins | 0 | 110 |
| Activity feed | 50 | 50 |
| Notifications | 21 | 15 |
| Suppliers | 6 | 1 |
| Tile orders | (pinned) 6 | 6 |

Counts drift legitimately as data changes; a **collapse to zero** where the report shows rows does not. Walk-ins first-floor is genuinely 0 — Sanitary has no walk-ins recorded.

If any row reads `LEAK:`, **stop**. That is a genuine Phase 1 finding arriving early. Record it in Task 6's results file, do not commit, and report it before proceeding.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit the harness**

```bash
cd "/Users/yashvardhansinhjhala/buildcon house/forge2.0" && git add backend/scripts/probe_floor_isolation.py && git commit -m "Add committed floor-isolation probe harness

The previous session's probe lived in a session-scoped scratchpad and was
lost, which is why its results could not be trusted. This version lives in
the repo and exits non-zero on leak, so it is usable as a gate."
```

## Task 2: Verify C-1 — follow-up automation is alive

The report claims the reconciler was dead app-wide because `followups.source_key` is uniquely indexed across all statuses, so any trigger whose condition still held after a human closed its card raised `E11000` and killed the entire pass. Claimed fix: also read closed keys, plus a `DuplicateKeyError` guard.

**Files:**
- Verify only: `backend/services/followup_engine.py`, `backend/tests/unit/test_followup_reconcile_closed_keys.py`

- [ ] **Step 1: Confirm the failure condition still exists in live data**

Run:
```bash
cd "/Users/yashvardhansinhjhala/buildcon house/forge2.0/backend" && ./.venv/bin/python -c "
import asyncio
from db import db
async def main():
    closed = await db.followups.count_documents({'status': {'\$nin': ['open','snoozed']}, 'source_key': {'\$ne': None}})
    total  = await db.followups.count_documents({})
    print(f'closed rows holding a source_key: {closed}')
    print(f'total followups: {total}')
asyncio.run(main())
"
```
Expected: a non-zero closed count (the report observed 83). This proves the collision condition is real and still present — so the fix is being exercised, not merely dormant.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the reconciler live and confirm it completes**

Run:
```bash
cd "/Users/yashvardhansinhjhala/buildcon house/forge2.0/backend" && T=$(curl -s -X POST 127.0.0.1:8010/api/auth/login -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"email":"owner@forge.app","password":"Forge@2026"}' | ./.venv/bin/python -c 'import sys,json;print(json.load(sys.stdin)["access_token"])') && curl -s -X POST 127.0.0.1:8010/api/followups/reconcile -H "Authorization: Bearer $T" -H "X-Floor-Id: ground-floor"
```
Expected: a JSON summary object (created/resolved/unchanged counts), **not** a 500 and not an `E11000` error. A completed pass against a database that contains closed source_keys is the actual proof.

- [ ] **Step 3: Run the targeted regression test**

Run:
```bash
cd "/Users/yashvardhansinhjhala/buildcon house/forge2.0/backend" && ./.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/unit/test_followup_reconcile_closed_keys.py -v
```
Expected: all tests PASS.

- [ ] **Step 4: Record the result** — append PASS/FAIL with observed counts to the results file created in Task 6.

## Task 3: Verify C-2 — activity and notification floor isolation

The report claims `activity_events` and `notifications` had no `floor_id` at all, that the field was added and stamped in `log_event`/`notify`, and that migration `0014` backfilled 1856/2510 events and 38/39 notifications. It also claims `GET /activity/product/{id}` previously had **no access check of any kind**.

**Files:**
- Verify only: `backend/services/activity_log.py`, `backend/services/notifications.py`, `backend/routes/activity_routes.py`, `backend/migrations/0014_backfill_activity_notification_floor_id.py`

- [ ] **Step 1: Confirm the migration ran and the backfill numbers are real**

Run:
```bash
cd "/Users/yashvardhansinhjhala/buildcon house/forge2.0/backend" && ./.venv/bin/python -c "
import asyncio
from db import db
async def main():
    applied = await db.schema_migrations.find_one({'version': '0014'})
    print('migration 0014 recorded:', bool(applied))
    for coll in ('activity_events', 'notifications'):
        total = await db[coll].count_documents({})
        stamped = await db[coll].count_documents({'floor_id': {'\$ne': None}})
        null = await db[coll].count_documents({'floor_id': None})
        missing = await db[coll].count_documents({'floor_id': {'\$exists': False}})
        print(f'{coll}: total={total} stamped={stamped} null={null} field-missing={missing}')
asyncio.run(main())
"
```
Expected: migration recorded `True`; both collections show `field-missing=0`. Deliberately-null rows are **correct by design** — the 0014 design decision is that unresolvable rows keep a null floor and are invisible to every unit, because guessing `first-floor` would file Ground Floor history under Sanitary.

- [ ] **Step 2: Confirm new writes are stamped, not just backfilled**

A backfill proves history was fixed. It does not prove `log_event` stamps going forward. Check the newest rows:

```bash
cd "/Users/yashvardhansinhjhala/buildcon house/forge2.0/backend" && ./.venv/bin/python -c "
import asyncio
from db import db
async def main():
    rows = await db.activity_events.find({}, {'_id':0,'event_type':1,'floor_id':1,'created_at':1}).sort('created_at',-1).limit(10).to_list(10)
    for r in rows: print(r)
asyncio.run(main())
"
```
Expected: recent events carry a concrete `floor_id`. If the newest rows are null while old ones are stamped, the backfill worked and the **stamping did not** — that is a FAIL and a real bug.

- [ ] **Step 3: Confirm the product-activity access check exists**

Run:
```bash
cd "/Users/yashvardhansinhjhala/buildcon house/forge2.0/backend" && grep -n "product" routes/activity_routes.py | head -20
```
Expected: the `/activity/product/{id}` handler has an auth dependency and a floor predicate. Read the handler body — a `Depends(get_current_user)` alone is not a floor check.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the regression tests**

Run:
```bash
cd "/Users/yashvardhansinhjhala/buildcon house/forge2.0/backend" && ./.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/unit/test_activity_floor_isolation.py tests/unit/test_migration_0014_activity_floor_backfill.py -v
```
Expected: all PASS.

- [ ] **Step 5: Record the result.**

---

## Task 4: Verify C-3 and H-1 — walk-in PII isolation and shortage cross-floor mutation

C-3 claims walk-in duplicate detection leaked customer PII across units and could auto-attach a walk-in to the other unit's customer via a HIGH-confidence phone match, and that `POST /walkins` accepted any `use_existing_customer_id` that merely existed. H-1 claims shortage create-PO/dismiss were unscoped, allowing a cross-floor **write** by id.

**Files:**
- Verify only: `backend/services/duplicate_detection.py`, `backend/services/walkin_service.py`, `backend/routes/walkin_routes.py`, `backend/routes/purchases_tracker.py`

- [ ] **Step 1: Find a real cross-unit phone collision in live data**

Run:
```bash
cd "/Users/yashvardhansinhjhala/buildcon house/forge2.0/backend" && ./.venv/bin/python -c "
import asyncio
from collections import defaultdict
from db import db
async def main():
    by_phone = defaultdict(set)
    async for c in db.customers.find({'phone': {'\$ne': None}}, {'_id':0,'phone':1,'floor_id':1,'id':1}):
        by_phone[c['phone']].add(c.get('floor_id'))
    cross = {p: f for p, f in by_phone.items() if len(f) > 1}
    print(f'phones present in more than one unit: {len(cross)}')
    for p, f in list(cross.items())[:5]: print(' ', p, sorted(map(str, f)))
asyncio.run(main())
"
```
Record the result. If cross-unit phones exist, they are the exact input the leak needed — Step 2 becomes a live reproduction attempt. If zero exist, note that the code fix cannot be disproven by live data and the unit test is the binding evidence.

- [ ] **Step 2: Confirm the duplicate check is floor-scoped in code**

Run:
```bash
cd "/Users/yashvardhansinhjhala/buildcon house/forge2.0/backend" && grep -n "floor" services/duplicate_detection.py
```
Expected: every customer lookup in this module carries a floor predicate. A module with zero `floor` matches is a FAIL.

- [ ] **Step 3: Confirm shortage routes are floor-scoped**

Run:
```bash
cd "/Users/yashvardhansinhjhala/buildcon house/forge2.0/backend" && grep -n "shortage" routes/purchases_tracker.py | grep -in "floor_query\|floor_for_write\|def \|@router"
```
Expected: each shortage handler's `find_one`/`update_one` goes through `floor_query(user, ...)`, not a bare `{"id": shortage_id}`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the regression test**

Run:
```bash
cd "/Users/yashvardhansinhjhala/buildcon house/forge2.0/backend" && ./.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/unit/test_walkin_duplicate_floor_isolation.py -v
```
Expected: all PASS.

- [ ] **Step 5: Record the result.**

## Task 5: Verify H-2 and H-3 — download-token floor binding and Ground Floor nav

H-2 claims `?dl=` browser downloads ran with no active floor, and that the token now records and replays the minting floor. H-3 claims the Quotations nav item showed on Ground Floor where it listed nothing, and that its "New Quotation" button silently switched the user's business unit.

**Files:**
- Verify only: `backend/services/download_tokens.py`, `frontend/app/(admin)/_layout.tsx`

- [ ] **Step 1: Confirm the token records a floor**

Run:
```bash
cd "/Users/yashvardhansinhjhala/buildcon house/forge2.0/backend" && grep -n "floor\|session_id" services/download_tokens.py
```
Expected: the minted token record carries both the minting `floor_id` and `session_id`. Missing `session_id` re-introduces the 2026-07-31 bug where every browser download 401'd.

- [ ] **Step 2: Exercise a real download end to end**

Generate a quotation PDF through the `?dl=` path in the browser as owner on Ground Floor, and confirm the file downloads (HTTP 200, `%PDF-` magic bytes, non-trivial size). Then confirm single-use replay of the same token returns 401.

- [ ] **Step 3: Run the regression test**

Run:
```bash
cd "/Users/yashvardhansinhjhala/buildcon house/forge2.0/backend" && ./.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/unit/test_download_token_floor_binding.py -v
```
Expected: all PASS.

- [ ] **Step 4: Confirm the nav restriction exists**

Run:
```bash
cd "/Users/yashvardhansinhjhala/buildcon house/forge2.0" && grep -n "floors:" "frontend/app/(admin)/_layout.tsx"
```
Expected: the Quotations entries in `PRIMARY`, `PHONE_TABS`, and `MORE_ITEMS` carry `floors: [SANITARY_FLOOR_ID]`.

**Note for Phase 3:** the Purchases entries in the same lists have **no** `floors` restriction and are therefore visible on Ground Floor today. That is expected at Phase 0 and is Phase 3's work. Confirm it is still true and record it — do not fix it here.

- [ ] **Step 5: Verify in the browser at three viewports**

Log in as owner. On **Ground Floor**, confirm Quotations is absent from the sidebar, the phone tab bar, and the More sheet. Switch to **Sanitary Bathroom** and confirm it returns. Check at 375 px, 768 px, and 1280 px.

Use `getBoundingClientRect()` / DOM assertions rather than screenshots — the Browser pane's screenshot scaling is unreliable above ~506 px, while DOM metrics stay correct. RN-Web `Pressable` ignores synthetic clicks; dispatch `pointerdown/mousedown/pointerup/mouseup/click` via JS on the element, walking 3–4 ancestors.

- [ ] **Step 6: Record the result.**

## Task 6: Full regression and results record

**Files:**
- Create: `docs/superpowers/verification/2026-08-02-phase-0-results.md`

- [ ] **Step 1: Run the backend suite**

Run:
```bash
cd "/Users/yashvardhansinhjhala/buildcon house/forge2.0/backend" && ./.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/unit -q 2>&1 | tail -15
```
Expected: **713 passed, 0 failed.** The report claims 713 (up from 676). A lower total means tests were lost; any failure blocks the commit.

- [ ] **Step 2: Typecheck the frontend**

Run:
```bash
cd "/Users/yashvardhansinhjhala/buildcon house/forge2.0/frontend" && npx tsc --noEmit
```
Expected: clean, zero errors. Per the 2026-08-01 note, the long-standing `TileOrderCard.tsx:107` error is gone — treat **any** error as new.

- [ ] **Step 3: Browser smoke pass**

With Metro on `:8081`, load dashboard, walk-ins, quotations, catalog, customers, purchases, payments, follow-ups, tiles, tile orders, notifications, settings on both units. Confirm every route renders content with zero console errors, zero React warnings, zero unhandled rejections. At 375 px confirm `document.scrollWidth === window.innerWidth` on each.

If Metro serves stale content, verify by fetching the entry bundle and grepping for a string unique to a recent edit; restart if absent.

- [ ] **Step 4: Write the results file**

Record, for each of C-1, C-2, C-3, H-1, H-2, H-3: the claim, the check run, the observed value, and PASS or FAIL. Include the probe table from Task 1, suite totals, and the Phase 3 pre-condition noted in Task 5 Step 4. State explicitly which claims were verified against live data versus code inspection alone — they are not equally strong evidence.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit the results file**

```bash
cd "/Users/yashvardhansinhjhala/buildcon house/forge2.0" && git add docs/superpowers/verification/2026-08-02-phase-0-results.md && git commit -m "Record Phase 0 re-verification results"
```

---

## Task 7: Commit the baseline

**Gate:** every task above is PASS, or has a recorded fix that was re-verified. If anything is FAIL, stop and report — do not commit.

- [ ] **Step 1: Review the full diff**

```bash
cd "/Users/yashvardhansinhjhala/buildcon house/forge2.0" && git status --short && git diff --stat
```
Expected: 17 modified backend/frontend files plus the untracked migration, 5 test files, `RELEASE_REPORT_2026-08-02.md`, and the spec/plan docs.

- [ ] **Step 2: Read every modified file's diff**

```bash
cd "/Users/yashvardhansinhjhala/buildcon house/forge2.0" && git diff
```
Confirm each change corresponds to a claim verified above. **Anything in the diff that no claim explains is a finding** — an unrelated edit riding along in an unreviewed working tree is exactly what a trusted baseline must exclude. Report it rather than committing it silently.

- [ ] **Step 3: Confirm `.superpowers/` stays untracked**

```bash
cd "/Users/yashvardhansinhjhala/buildcon house/forge2.0" && git check-ignore -v .superpowers/ || echo "NOT IGNORED — do not add"
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
cd "/Users/yashvardhansinhjhala/buildcon house/forge2.0" && git add backend/ frontend/ docs/ RELEASE_REPORT_2026-08-02.md && git status --short && git commit -m "Commit re-verified floor-isolation baseline

Re-verifies every claim in RELEASE_REPORT_2026-08-02.md against the live
database and running application rather than trusting the report:

- C-1 follow-up reconciler survives closed source_key collisions
- C-2 activity_events/notifications floor_id stamped on write, 0014 backfilled
- C-3 walk-in duplicate detection scoped per business unit
- H-1 shortage mutations floor-scoped
- H-2 download tokens bind minting floor and session
- H-3 Quotations nav restricted to Sanitary Bathroom

Backend suite 713 passed; tsc clean; 10/10 endpoints isolated under probe."
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Confirm a clean tree**

```bash
cd "/Users/yashvardhansinhjhala/buildcon house/forge2.0" && git status --short
```
Expected: empty except ignored paths. **Do not push** — pushing is a separate decision for the owner.

---

## Phase 0 exit criteria

- Probe harness committed; 10/10 endpoints isolated.
- All six report claims re-verified against live data or explicitly marked code-inspection-only.
- Backend suite 713 passed; `tsc --noEmit` clean.
- Browser smoke pass with zero console errors on both units.
- Working tree clean; baseline committed, not pushed.
- Results file records what was checked, how, and what was observed.
