# Forge Performance Sprint 3 — Authenticated Baseline Report

**Test Date:** 2026-07-12  
**Test Type:** READ-ONLY authenticated baseline measurement  
**Status:** ❌ **COMPLETELY BLOCKED BY AUTHENTICATION FAILURE**

---

## Executive Summary

Performance Sprint 3 testing was requested to measure authenticated baseline performance across desktop (1920x800), tablet (1024x768), and mobile (390x844) viewports for three main routes:
- `/catalog`
- `/quotations/new`
- `/purchases`

**CRITICAL FINDING:** 100% of Sprint 3 performance testing is BLOCKED by a complete authentication system failure in the frontend. The backend API works perfectly, but the frontend login flow is completely broken and prevents any authenticated testing.

---

## Authentication Failure Analysis

### Backend API Status: ✅ WORKING PERFECTLY

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"owner@forge.app","password":"Forge@2026"}'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "user": {
    "id": "6340533e-ea94-4ceb-828b-0e8cbad41a46",
    "email": "owner@forge.app",
    "full_name": "Aarav Kapoor",
    "role": "owner",
    "active": true
  }
}
```

✅ Backend returns 200 OK  
✅ Valid JWT token generated  
✅ User data correct  
✅ Session ID created  

### Frontend Login UI: ❌ COMPLETELY BROKEN

**Issue 1: Button Not Clickable via Playwright**

The login page loads correctly at `/login` with:
- ✅ Email field accepts input: `owner@forge.app`
- ✅ Password field accepts input: `Forge@2026`
- ✅ "Sign in" button is VISIBLE in the UI
- ❌ "Sign in" button is NOT CLICKABLE via Playwright automation

**Selectors Attempted (all failed with 5000ms timeout):**
1. `button[data-testid="login-submit"]` - Timeout
2. `button[type="submit"]` - Timeout
3. `button:has-text("Sign in")` - Timeout
4. `button >> text="Sign in"` - Timeout
5. `button` (generic selector) - Timeout

**Root Cause:** React Native Web + Expo Router compatibility issue with Playwright. The button exists in the DOM but Playwright cannot interact with it.

**Issue 2: Token Injection Also Failed**

Attempted to bypass the UI login by:
1. ✅ Obtaining valid JWT token from backend API
2. ✅ Injecting token into localStorage: `localStorage.setItem('forge.jwt', token)`
3. ✅ Injecting token kind: `localStorage.setItem('forge.jwt.kind', 'staff')`
4. ❌ Navigating to `/dashboard` → **REDIRECTED BACK TO `/login`**

Even with a valid token in localStorage, the app still redirects to the login page. This confirms the issue is in the frontend routing/AuthGate logic, not just the UI button.

## Root Cause Analysis

This is a **KNOWN RECURRING ISSUE** documented extensively in `test_result.md`:

### Previous Occurrences

**test_result.md Lines 4106-4177:** "CRITICAL BLOCKER — Mobile testing completely blocked by authentication failure"

**test_result.md Lines 4127-4134:**
> "Backend API works perfectly: POST /api/auth/login returns 200 OK with valid JWT token. Frontend login form accepts credentials. BUT: After clicking 'Sign in', page stays stuck on /login indefinitely"

**test_result.md Lines 4136-4142:** "ROOT CAUSE (Code Review):"
- `login.tsx` line 75-76: After `loginStaff()` succeeds, calls `router.replace('/(admin)/dashboard')`
- `auth.tsx` line 154-156: `loginStaff()` sets token and updates state
- `_layout.tsx` line 29-42: `AuthGate` component watches auth state and redirects
- **RACE CONDITION:** `router.replace()` doesn't complete before `AuthGate` redirects back to `/login`

### Code Locations

**Files Involved:**
- `frontend/app/(auth)/login.tsx` - Login form and submit handler
- `frontend/src/contexts/auth.tsx` - Authentication state management
- `frontend/app/_layout.tsx` - AuthGate component and routing logic

**The Race Condition:**
1. User clicks "Sign in"
2. `loginStaff()` is called and succeeds
3. Token is stored in localStorage
4. `router.replace('/(admin)/dashboard')` is called
5. **BUT** `AuthGate` component detects the navigation before auth state fully updates
6. `AuthGate` redirects back to `/login` because it thinks user is not authenticated
7. User is stuck on login page despite having valid token

### Previous Fix Attempt

According to `test_result.md` lines 203-211, a fix was previously attempted:
> "The fix was in login.tsx lines 77-82. Previously, the submit handler called router.replace() which raced with AuthGate's own navigation, causing the app to get stuck on /login. The fix removes router.replace() from the submit handler and lets AuthGate (app/_layout.tsx lines 31-44) handle navigation exclusively by reacting to the `kind` state change."

**This fix appears to have REGRESSED or was never fully working.**

## Impact Assessment

### Blocked Testing Areas

❌ **Cannot test ANY of the following Sprint 3 requirements:**

1. **Network Performance**
   - Network waterfalls and exact API request counts
   - Duplicate URL detection
   - Initial vs scroll page requests
   - API response times

2. **Catalog Route (`/catalog`)**
   - Families mode vs Variants mode comparison
   - Scroll behavior to product #2966
   - Highest loaded/reachable item
   - Unique IDs/cards count

## Evidence

### Screenshots

1. **Login Page with Credentials Filled**
   - Location: `.screenshots/login_failed.png`
   - Shows: Email and password fields filled, "Sign in" button visible but not clickable

2. **Authentication Failed After Token Injection**
   - Location: `.screenshots/auth_failed.png`
   - Shows: Still on login page after token injection, confirming routing issue

### Console Logs

- Location: `/root/.emergent/automation_output/*/console_*.log`
- Contains: Browser console output during failed authentication attempts

---

## Recommendations

### CRITICAL PRIORITY: Fix Authentication System

**Main agent MUST fix the authentication system before ANY Sprint 3 performance testing can proceed.**

### Suggested Fix Approach

1. **Review Recent Changes**
   - Check `login.tsx` lines 75-82 (the auth unblock fix from earlier)
   - Check `_layout.tsx` lines 29-44 (AuthGate component)
   - The previous fix may have regressed or was incomplete

2. **Use Web Search**
   - Search for: "Expo Router authentication redirect race condition"
   - Search for: "React Native Web Expo Router AuthGate pattern"
   - Search for: "Expo Router navigation after login stuck"

3. **Alternative Auth Flow**
   - Set token in localStorage FIRST
   - Update auth context state SYNCHRONOUSLY
   - Let AuthGate handle ALL navigation (remove manual router.replace())
   - Ensure AuthGate waits for auth state to fully update before redirecting

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - Test the fix manually in browser FIRST
   - Verify login → dashboard navigation works
   - Verify token persistence after page reload
   - Verify direct navigation to `/catalog` works when authenticated
   - THEN call testing agent again for Sprint 3 performance testing

### DO NOT ATTEMPT

- Do not attempt Sprint 3 performance testing until authentication is verified working
- Do not try to work around the auth issue with mocks or stubs
- Do not skip authentication testing - it's a prerequisite for all other tests

## Historical Context

This authentication issue has blocked testing **MULTIPLE TIMES** in this project:

1. **Lines 359-842:** Previous auth blocking issues
2. **Lines 724-842:** Auth unblock verification attempts
3. **Lines 4106-4177:** Mobile testing blocked by auth failure
4. **Lines 4127-4159:** Detailed root cause analysis and recommendations

**Stuck Count:** This is at least the **3rd or 4th occurrence** of this exact issue.

---

## Conclusion

**Sprint 3 performance testing is 100% BLOCKED by a critical authentication system failure.**

The backend API works perfectly. The issue is entirely in the frontend routing/auth logic. This is a known recurring issue that has been documented multiple times in the project history.

**RECOMMENDATION:** Main agent should prioritize fixing the authentication system using web search for Expo Router auth patterns, then re-run Sprint 3 performance testing once authentication is verified working.
