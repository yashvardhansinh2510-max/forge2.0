# AGENTS.md — BuildCon House ERP (forge2.0)

Guidance for any AI agent (Emergent, Claude Code, or otherwise) picking up work in this repo. Read this before re-deriving context from scratch — it's meant to save tokens, not replace judgment.

## What this project is

FastAPI + MongoDB Atlas (cloud, not local) + Supabase (file storage) backend, Expo/React Native Web frontend (Expo Router). A multi-floor ERP for a bathroom-fittings + tiles distributor: `first-floor` (display name "The Sanitary Bathroom") holds the existing ~2,600-product sanitaryware catalog and all real business data today; `ground-floor` is the new tile section (schema/isolation work in progress, no real tile data yet); `second-floor` also exists as a floor entity but is otherwise unused so far.

- Live Atlas DB: `buildcon_house` (not `buildcon`, a stale demo DB on the same cluster).
- Supabase buckets: `forge-products` (public), `forge-private`.
- Local dev: `backend/.venv` (Python 3.14), `backend/.env` / `frontend/.env` hold real credentials (gitignored, not committed — verified clean).
- Backend commonly runs on port 8010 (`uvicorn server:app --port 8010`) since something else occupies 8000 on the primary dev Mac.

## Important — this repo has concurrent editors

**This repo is being worked on by more than one agent/process at once.** As of 2026-07-18 there were ~99–106 files sitting uncommitted in the working tree from a separate, non-Claude-Code process (git log shows a long history of `auto-commit for <uuid>` entries — almost certainly an Emergent-platform agent working the same codebase in parallel). That work is legitimate and already includes real, wanted fixes (e.g. a session-security hardening pass in `auth.py`, an optimistic-concurrency rewrite of `_apply_stage_change` in `purchases_tracker.py`, and a role-permission fix lowering `move_item`/`bulk_move`/`transfer_item*` from `require_min_role("sales")` to `"warehouse"`).

**If you are about to commit and a file you're touching has other unrelated uncommitted changes in it: do not sweep them into your commit.** `git add <file>` stages the whole file, not just your diff — use `git add -p` and select only your own hunks, so each commit accurately describes its own contents and the other process's in-progress work isn't silently relabeled or buried under an unrelated commit message. This was a real mistake made and then corrected during the floor-isolation-fix work below — see that section for the concrete example.

**Update (2026-07-18):** all ~99 files of that backlog have now been committed as `96ffda2` ("chore: commit accumulated prior-session work..."), since Task 1's isolated commit turned out to depend on foundational `auth.py` helpers (`floor_query`/`floor_for_write`/`accessible_floor_ids`) that were themselves part of that uncommitted backlog — every prior session's work had been sitting uncommitted, at real risk of loss, this whole time. Going forward, the working tree should stay much closer to git history; if you find a large uncommitted backlog again, treat it the same way (commit it honestly labeled as pre-existing work, don't silently absorb it into an unrelated task commit).

## Current effort: floor-isolation fix + tile-ready catalog schema

**Root cause (confirmed 2026-07-17 by direct query against the live Atlas DB, not assumption):** every real record in the database — all 2,601 products, 69 follow-ups, 13 purchase orders, 12 payments, 5 customers, 41 quotations, 5 suppliers — was tagged `floor_id="first-floor"`, and switching the UI to Ground floor showed that same first-floor data instead of an empty state, because a specific, mechanically-identifiable set of backend read *and* write paths never applied floor scoping at all. Full root-cause writeup, the complete list of every affected code site, and exact before/after code for every fix are in:

**`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-17-floor-isolation-and-tile-catalog-design.md`** (design/spec — read this for *why*)
**`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-17-floor-isolation-fix.md`** (implementation plan — read this for *exact code*, task-by-task, TDD-style)

Do not re-derive the root cause or re-scan the codebase for affected endpoints — both are already fully enumerated in those two files. If you need to know "is X in scope," check the plan's 20 task headers first.

**Status as of 2026-07-18: all 20 planned tasks complete, plus a final holistic review (see below), plus 2 additional gaps that review found — everything reviewed (spec compliance + code quality, two-stage per task) and pushed to `origin/main` at commit `f86a43e`.** One live operational blocker remains before the app can be safely restarted against production — see "⚠️ Migration `0006`" below — and two small follow-up tasks were spawned separately (not blocking, not started; see "Spawned follow-ups" at the end of this file).

**Final holistic review** (after all 20 tasks landed): traced 3 end-to-end user scenarios through the actual HEAD code (floor switch → Purchases Tracker; quotation → auto-PO → customer transfer; follow-ups tab), confirmed `floor_id` is correctly read/written/scoped at every hop with no gap in any detailed-record path. Did an independent fresh sweep of all `count_documents`/`aggregate` calls across `routes/`/`services/` (not just trusting the plan's own enumeration) and found 2 real gaps of the same bug class — both count/badge-level leaks, not detailed-record leaks: `dashboard_routes.py`'s product-count KPI and `followup_routes.py`'s per-rule badge counts were still global (the first had a stale "not scoped yet" comment left over from before Catalog was floor-scoped; the second predated the `user`-threading convention). Both fixed, tested, reviewed, and pushed (`f86a43e`). A second, independent sweep after that fix confirmed no third gap of the same shape remains on any staff-facing endpoint. Full backend test suite: 90 passed.

### Established pattern (use this, don't invent a new one)

- `floor_query(user, base)` — Mongo filter dict, for queries that take a filter (`db.collection.find(floor_query(user, {...}))`).
- `floor_for_write(user)` — single floor_id string, for **human-initiated** creates (`Quotation(..., floor_id=floor_for_write(user))`).
- `floor_scope_ids(user)` — plain `Optional[list[str]]`, for code that builds its own aggregation pipeline or in-memory filter instead of taking a Mongo filter dict (added in Task 1 of the plan above).
- **Automation/event-handler-created records** (background workflows with no live user, e.g. `domain_outbox.py`, `transfer_workflow.py`, `followup_engine.py`) inherit `floor_id` from their immediate **source document** instead — never `floor_for_write()` — since these handlers often only have an actor id/name string, and a record derived from a ground-floor source must stay ground-floor regardless of which floor the triggering user happens to have selected. Use `floor_inherit(source)` from `auth.py` for this (added alongside `floor_query`/`floor_for_write`/`floor_scope_ids` — this consolidates what used to be four duplicated per-file helpers; don't reintroduce a fifth local copy).

All four live in `backend/auth.py` (the first three) or as small local helpers next to their one caller (the fourth kind) — don't scatter re-implementations of the same logic across files.

| 11 | `transfer_workflow.py::handle_purchase_transferred` | **Done** (spec passed; code-quality found a real issue — first test was a no-op, fixed by reusing `_transfer_floor_id`, re-reviewed and approved) | `c07be25`, `3dbca7b` |
| 12 | Legacy inline transfer/reorder code in `purchases_tracker.py` | **Done** (spec + code-quality review both passed; reviewer flagged cross-file helper duplication as a non-blocking follow-up — see below) | `5c25ca5` |

**Bonus cleanup (not one of the 20 plan tasks):** Task 12's reviewer flagged that `_transfer_floor_id` (transfer_workflow.py), `_source_floor_id` (purchases_tracker.py), `_followup_floor_id` (followup_engine.py), and three inline copies in `domain_outbox.py` were all near-identical reimplementations of "inherit floor_id from source, default to first-floor." A separate session consolidated these into one `auth.floor_inherit(source)` helper alongside `floor_query`/`floor_for_write`/`floor_scope_ids`. Pure refactor, no behavior change, full suite passes (74/74). Commit `b5ecee4`.
| 14 | `Brand`/`Category` gain `floor_id` + backfill migration `0004` | **Done** (spec + code-quality review both passed) | `b4a0f79` |
| 15 | Floor-scope the in-memory catalog engine (`catalog_service.py`) | **Done** (spec passed; code-quality found brand/category product-counts could leak across floors if the "no brand spans two floors" invariant were ever violated — fixed by scoping the Counter too, re-reviewed and approved) | `1a1a787`, `7fab437` |
| 16 | Thread floor scope through Catalog routes; fix product-creation floor default | **Done** (spec + code-quality review both passed) | `febe99f` |
| 17 | `POST /brands`, `POST /categories` | **Done** (spec passed; code-quality found `categories.slug` had no unique index — unlike `brands.slug` — leaving a real check-then-act race, and no test existed for `create_category`; both fixed, re-reviewed and approved) | `1042ed4`, `ab225ca` |
| 18 | `size` field on `Product` + search/facets | **Done** (spec passed; code-quality found `size` wasn't wired into `search_catalog`'s scoring or `hydrate_variants_batch`'s sibling-variant hydration — the second one would have silently broken Task 20 — both fixed, re-reviewed and approved) | `a2662ab`, `047694e` |
| 19 | SKU uniqueness migration `0006` (per floor+brand, **renumbered from 0005** — Task 17's categories.slug index fix took `0005` first) | **Code written, tested, spec + code-quality reviewed and approved. Pushed to origin (CI has no deploy step and uses an isolated test DB, so this is safe) — but the migration itself must not reach a real deployment/restart until the live duplicate SKU is resolved.** See "⚠️ Task 19 is holding" below. | `4ab1b5a`, `658a92f` |
| 20 | Frontend `variantDescriptor()` helper + `PickerCard`/`VariantChip`/`SwapSheet`/`ProductModal` display fix | **Done** (spec + code-quality review both passed; reviewer hand-traced all edge cases by hand since this repo has no frontend test runner) — **all 20 tasks complete** | `e889686` |

### ⚠️ Migration `0006` is a live landmine until the duplicate SKU is resolved — read this before restarting any backend process against the real database

Directly queried the live Atlas database (2026-07-18) and confirmed the known duplicate SKU is still real and unresolved: SKU `26456000` under brand `9b72519c-bfb4-4576-9e79-e85072ab4216` (Hansgrohe), two product documents (`639c8d2e-95e6-406b-a117-f18155b9519d` and `811a1b0f-1b20-401b-9f36-e8134b63bbf2`), both `floor_id="first-floor"`.

A code-quality reviewer traced what actually happens if migration `0006` (`backend/migrations/0006_products_sku_unique_per_floor_brand.py`) reaches a deployment before that duplicate is resolved: `backend/migrations/runner.py` auto-applies every pending migration at **every backend startup** (`server.py`'s startup event calls `run_migrations(db)` with no surrounding `try/except`, unlike the reconciliation call right below it), and there is no per-migration error handling in the runner either. So this isn't "don't run `scripts/run_migrations.py` manually" — merely having this file present in `backend/migrations/` on a process pointed at the live DB means the **next process restart** hits an uncaught `DuplicateKeyError`, which aborts FastAPI startup entirely. Since the migration never gets recorded as applied on failure, this repeats on every subsequent restart — a boot crash loop, not a one-time error.

**The migration code itself is correct, fully tested (unit tests use only a fake in-memory db, no live connection), and both reviews passed — it has been committed AND pushed to `origin/main`** (commits `4ab1b5a`, `658a92f`). This is safe: CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) has no deploy step and runs unit tests against an isolated `MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017` / `DB_NAME=forge_ci_unit_tests`, never the real Atlas cluster — confirmed by reading the workflow file directly. The risk is NOT "this is on GitHub" — it's specifically **restarting any real backend process (local dev `uvicorn`, or an actual deployed instance) that connects to the live `buildcon_house` database** while this duplicate still exists. Do not restart the backend against the live database until:
1. The live duplicate is resolved: rename one of the two SKUs, or merge the two Hansgrohe products (`639c8d2e...` / `811a1b0f...`). This is a data decision for a human — the migration deliberately does not attempt to auto-resolve it.
2. Re-run the read-only check below to confirm zero duplicates remain:
   ```bash
   cd backend && .venv/bin/python -c "
   import asyncio
   from db import db
   async def main():
       dupes = await db.products.aggregate([
           {'\$group': {'_id': {'brand_id': '\$brand_id', 'sku': '\$sku'}, 'ids': {'\$push': '\$id'}, 'n': {'\$sum': 1}}},
           {'\$match': {'n': {'\$gt': 1}}},
       ]).to_list(50)
       print(dupes)
   asyncio.run(main())
   "
   ```
3. Only then restart/deploy the backend against the live database — the code is already committed and pushed, there's nothing further to push at that point.

See "Spawned follow-ups" near the end of this file for the two related background tasks (not blocking, not started).

**Explicitly out of scope for this plan** (decided with the user, don't re-litigate): no new MongoDB/Supabase infrastructure (already cloud-hosted, confirmed via `backend/.env`'s real Atlas `mongodb+srv://` URL); no tile product data import (schema/isolation only — data entry is separate, later work); no Cmd+K quick-search brand-scoping (confirmed not needed — Catalog page + Quotation Builder search, both fixed here, are what matter); no `LineRow`/`Line`-type/`QuotationLineItem` changes for `size` (LineRow only shows a colour swatch, not a text fallback chain — not affected by the bug this plan fixes).

### Spawned follow-ups (not blocking, not started as of 2026-07-18)

Both were flagged during code review of Task 17/19 as real gaps of the same shape as this whole plan, but explicitly out of each task's own scope — background task chips exist for a human to start with one click:

1. **`bootstrap.py` doesn't verify `brands`/`categories` indexes at startup.** `REQUIRED_INDEXES` checks `products`/`users`/`quotations`/`purchase_orders`/`customers`/`payments`/`suppliers`/`activity_events` but not `brands.slug`/`categories.slug` — so there's no automated guarantee those unique indexes (created by migrations `0004`... actually by `scripts/ensure_indexes.py` for brands, and migration `0005` for categories) actually exist in a live deployment.
2. **`catalog_routes.py`'s SKU duplicate-checks are still global.** `create_product`/`create_custom_product`/`update_product` all do `db.products.find_one({"sku": sku})` with no `floor_id`/`brand_id` scoping — so even once migration `0006` is safely deployed (relaxing the DB-level constraint to per-floor-per-brand), the API's own pre-check would still reject a legitimate cross-floor SKU reuse before it ever reaches the database. This is the one that actually matters for the tile catalog to work as intended once real data arrives — prioritize this one if only starting one of the two.

### If more floor-isolation work comes up later

1. Follow the same TDD pattern used throughout this plan (see any task in `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-17-floor-isolation-fix.md` for the shape: failing test → minimal `floor_query`/`floor_scope_ids`/`floor_inherit` fix → passing test → isolated commit).
2. Run backend tests from `backend/` using `.venv/bin/pytest tests/unit -q` (existing venv, don't create a new one). Current baseline as of 2026-07-18 is **90 passed, 0 failed** — any new failures are yours to explain, not pre-existing.
3. Before committing, run `git status --short` on the specific files you touched. If any of them show unrelated pre-existing changes beyond your own diff, use `git add -p` and select only your hunks (see "Important — this repo has concurrent editors" above). Don't skip this — it's the difference between a reviewable commit and a misleading one.
4. This repo pushes to `origin` (`https://github.com/yashvardhansinh2510-max/forge2.0.git`) on branch `main`. Confirm with the user before pushing if you're unsure whether local commits are ready — and see the migration `0006` warning above before ever restarting a backend process against the live database.

### Known gotchas (don't rediscover these the hard way)

- **Migration idempotency:** `backend/migrations/` migrations must be forward-only and safe to run twice, but MongoDB's `create_index` throws `OperationFailure` code 85 (`IndexOptionsConflict`) if a same-key index already exists under a different name — this has happened twice already (see `migrations/0002` and `0003`'s docstrings). Always wrap `create_index` calls the way `migrations/0003`'s `_create_index_tolerant` helper does.
- **Catalog is an in-memory snapshot, not per-request Mongo queries:** `backend/services/catalog_service.py` loads the whole product catalog into memory at startup (Atlas is ~228ms round-trip away; the full catalog is a few MB) and refreshes on writes. Don't add per-request Mongo queries to catalog read paths — thread new filters through the existing `_matches_filters`/snapshot functions instead.
- **Floor `first-floor`'s display name is "The Sanitary Bathroom"** in the live `db.floors` collection, but its `id`/`slug` is still literally `"first-floor"` — don't rename the slug, only ever the `name` field, or every `floor_id` reference throughout the codebase breaks.
