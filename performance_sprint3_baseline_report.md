# Forge Performance Sprint 3 - Baseline Measurement Report

**Date:** 2026-07-12  
**Test Type:** READ-ONLY BASELINE MEASUREMENT (No code modifications)  
**Tester:** Testing Agent  
**Authenticated User:** owner@forge.app (Aarav Kapoor)

---

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL BLOCKER FOUND:** Frontend authentication system is completely broken, preventing meaningful performance testing. While backend API authentication works perfectly (returns valid JWT tokens), the frontend login form and token injection mechanisms both fail to establish authenticated sessions.

### Test Status
- ❌ **BLOCKED** - Cannot complete comprehensive performance baseline due to authentication failure
- ✅ **PARTIAL DATA COLLECTED** - Basic navigation and network metrics captured
- ⚠️ **AUTHENTICATION BUG** - Same recurring issue documented in test_result.md history (lines 359-842, 724-842, 4029-4099)

---

## Test Configuration

### Viewports Tested
1. **Desktop:** 1920x800
2. **Tablet:** 1024x768  
3. **Mobile:** 390x844

### Routes Tested
1. `/(admin)/catalog`
2. `/(admin)/quotations/new`
3. `/(admin)/purchases`

### Test Credentials
- **Email:** owner@forge.app
- **Password:** Forge@2026
- **Backend API:** ✅ Working (returns valid JWT)
- **Frontend Login:** ❌ Broken (form submission fails, token injection fails)

---

## Critical Findings

### 1. Authentication System Failure

**Root Cause:**
- Backend `/api/auth/login` endpoint works perfectly (HTTP 200, valid JWT token returned)
- Frontend login form does NOT trigger authentication flow when "Sign in" button is clicked
- Token injection into localStorage also fails to establish authenticated session
- All authenticated routes return HTTP 401 errors
- Console shows: `"Missing bearer token"` and `"Failed to load builder reference data ApiError: Missing bearer token"`

**Evidence:**
- Login form fills correctly (email + password)
- Sign in button click does not trigger navigation
- Page remains stuck on `/login` after login attempt
- Direct navigation to authenticated routes redirects back to `/login`
- Token injection into localStorage does not persist or is not read by the app

**Impact:**
- **100% of requested performance testing is BLOCKED**
- Cannot measure:
  - Actual product/family rendering
  - Infinite scroll behavior
  - Image loading performance
  - DOM growth during scroll
  - Real-world API request patterns
  - Scroll FPS and rendering performance

**Historical Context:**
This is a **RECURRING BUG** documented multiple times in `/app/test_result.md`:
- Lines 359-842: "CRITICAL BUG FOUND — Product Grid Not Rendering" (blocked by auth)
- Lines 724-842: "CRITICAL BLOCKER — Mobile testing completely blocked by authentication failure"
- Lines 4029-4099: "CRITICAL BLOCKER — Mobile testing blocked by authentication failure"

**Recommendation:**
Main agent MUST fix authentication BEFORE any performance optimization work. Consider using websearch to find solutions for Expo Router + auth redirect race conditions.

## Network Analysis (All Viewports - Consistent Results)

### Catalog Route (`/catalog`)
**API Endpoints Called:**
- `/api/brands` (1x)
- `/api/categories` (1x)
- `/api/catalog/hierarchy` (1x)

**Status:** All return HTTP 401 (Unauthorized)

**Observations:**
- ✅ No duplicate API calls
- ❌ No product data loaded (0 visible products, 0 families)
- ❌ No scroll-triggered requests (DOM growth: 0 nodes)
- ⚠️ Minimal DOM (75 nodes) indicates empty/error state

### Quotation Builder Route (`/quotations/new`)
**API Endpoints Called:**
- `/api/brands` (1x)
- `/api/categories` (2x) ⚠️ **DUPLICATE**
- `/api/customers` (1x)
- `/api/products/recent` (1x)
- `/api/products/frequent` (1x)
- `/api/quotations/recent` (1x)

**Status:** All return HTTP 401 (Unauthorized)

**Observations:**
- ⚠️ **1 duplicate API call:** `/api/categories` called twice
- ❌ No product grid loaded (0 visible product cards)
- ❌ No line items (0 quotation lines)
- ❌ Scroll does not trigger additional product loads
- ⚠️ Console error: `"Failed to load builder reference data ApiError: Missing bearer token"`
- ⚠️ React 19 deprecation warning: `"Accessing element.ref was removed in React 19"`

### Purchases Route (`/purchases`)
**API Endpoints Called:**
- `/api/purchases/brands` (1x)
- `/api/purchases/shortages` (1x)
- `/api/purchases/stages` (1x)

**Status:** All return HTTP 401 (Unauthorized)

**Observations:**
- ✅ **Does NOT fetch product catalog** (0 `/api/products` calls)
- ✅ No duplicate API calls
- ❌ No purchase order cards visible (0 PO cards)
- ⚠️ Minimal DOM (75 nodes) indicates empty/error state

---

## Performance Metrics (Limited Validity)

### First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- **Desktop:** 484-540ms
- **Tablet:** 484-536ms
- **Mobile:** 488-500ms

⚠️ **Note:** FCP measures only the login page/error state, not actual content rendering.

### JavaScript Heap Size
- **All viewports:** ~24.8 MB

⚠️ **Note:** Heap size is minimal because no product data is loaded.

### DOM Node Count
- **Catalog:** 75 nodes (empty state)
- **Quotation Builder:** 76 nodes (empty state)
- **Purchases:** 75 nodes (empty state)

⚠️ **Note:** Normal authenticated pages would have 1000+ nodes with product grids.

---

## Console Errors & Warnings

### Errors (Per Route)
- **Catalog:** 3 errors (all HTTP 401)
- **Quotation Builder:** 8 errors (HTTP 401 + React 19 ref deprecation)
- **Purchases:** 3 errors (all HTTP 401)

### Warnings (Consistent Across All Routes)
1. `"shadow*" style props are deprecated. Use "boxShadow"`
2. `"Animated: useNativeDriver is not supported"` (React Native Web limitation)
3. `"props.pointerEvents is deprecated. Use style.pointerEvents"`
4. `"Accessing element.ref was removed in React 19"` (Quotation Builder only)

### Failed Requests
- All `/api/*` endpoints: HTTP 401 (Unauthorized)
- `/cdn-cgi/rum?`: ERR_ABORTED (Cloudflare RUM, non-critical)

---

## What Could NOT Be Measured

Due to authentication failure, the following critical performance metrics **could not be collected**:

### Catalog Page
- ❌ Visible product/family count (actual vs expected 2,966 products)
- ❌ Scroll-triggered infinite loading behavior
- ❌ Highest reachable product index
- ❌ Duplicate/missing products in pagination
- ❌ DOM growth during scroll
- ❌ Scroll restoration after route change
- ❌ Search/filter/category behavior
- ❌ Image loading patterns (lazy/eager, cache headers, transfer sizes)

### Quotation Builder
- ❌ Initial product request count
- ❌ Infinite scroll product requests
- ❌ Repeated `onEndReached` calls
- ❌ Duplicate page URLs in pagination
- ❌ Highest reachable product count
- ❌ Product grid DOM node count (with actual products)
- ❌ Request behavior after navigating away/back

### Purchases
- ✅ **Confirmed:** Does NOT fetch product catalog (0 `/api/products` calls)
- ❌ List rendering strategy (cannot see actual PO cards)
- ❌ DOM node count with actual data

### Image Behavior
- ❌ Unique image URLs vs requests
- ❌ Duplicate image requests
- ❌ Transfer sizes
- ❌ Cache response headers / browser transferSize
- ❌ Lazy/eager loading evidence
- ❌ Decode/load durations

### Rendering/Performance
- ❌ Route click-to-visible (with actual content)
- ❌ Long tasks
- ❌ Scroll FPS approximation
- ❌ Mount/remount evidence
- ❌ React DevTools Profiler data (unavailable in headless browser)

## Recommendations for Main Agent

### Priority 1: Fix Authentication (CRITICAL)
1. **Debug the login form submission flow**
   - Check `frontend/app/(auth)/login.tsx` line 75-76: `router.replace("/(admin)/dashboard")` after `loginStaff()`
   - Check `frontend/src/contexts/auth.tsx` line 154-156: `loginStaff()` token storage
   - Check `frontend/app/(admin)/_layout.tsx` line 29-42: `AuthGate` redirect logic

2. **Root cause:** Race condition between `router.replace()` and `AuthGate` redirects
   - `router.replace()` doesn't complete before `AuthGate` redirects back to `/login`
   - Token may not be persisting to storage or being read correctly

3. **Recommended approach:**
   - Use **websearch** to find solutions for "Expo Router auth redirect race condition"
   - Consider using Expo Router's `useRootNavigationState()` to wait for navigation readiness
   - Ensure token is stored BEFORE navigation attempt
   - Add proper loading states during auth transitions

### Priority 2: Re-run Performance Baseline (After Auth Fix)
Once authentication is working, re-run this exact test to collect:
- Actual product/family rendering metrics
- Infinite scroll behavior and request patterns
- Image loading performance and caching
- DOM growth and scroll FPS
- Real-world API request counts and duplicates

### Priority 3: Address Known Issues (Lower Priority)
1. **Quotation Builder:** Fix duplicate `/api/categories` call (called 2x on mount)
2. **React 19 Compatibility:** Fix `element.ref` deprecation warning
3. **Style Deprecations:** Update `shadow*` props to `boxShadow`, `pointerEvents` to style

## Conclusion

**Performance Sprint 3 baseline measurement is BLOCKED by a critical authentication bug.** While basic navigation metrics were collected (~3.3s page loads, minimal DOM), no meaningful performance data about product rendering, infinite scroll, image loading, or user interactions could be measured.

**The authentication system must be fixed before any frontend performance optimization work can begin.** This is a recurring issue that has blocked testing multiple times in the project's history.

**Backend is confirmed working** (API returns valid tokens), so the issue is isolated to the frontend authentication flow (Expo Router + auth state management).

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Main agent fixes authentication bug (use websearch for Expo Router auth solutions)
2. Testing agent re-runs this exact baseline measurement with working auth
3. Compare results against Performance Sprint 3 optimization targets
4. Proceed with frontend optimization work based on actual baseline data
