6. Navigate to: `/(admin)/quotations/new`

### Checkpoint (a): Open the catalog
**Expected behavior:**
- **Phone (390px)**: Look for "Add" button in bottom footer bar (testID=`mobile-add-first`)
- **Tablets (800px, 810px)**: Look for "Browse catalog" button in empty order panel (testID=`empty-browse-catalog`)

**Test:**
- Tap the appropriate button
- Verify catalog opens with search box visible (testID=`explorer-search`)

**Screenshot:** `{size}_catalog_open.png`

**Screenshot:** `{size}_customer_picker.png`

**Test continued:**
3. Pick any customer from the list (e.g., "Rajesh Malhotra")

**Screenshot:** `{size}_discount_sheet.png`

**Test continued:**
3. Find the discount percentage input field
4. Type "10" into the percent field

6. Observe the grand total

**Screenshot:** `{size}_discount_applied.png`

**Pass criteria:**

### Checkpoint (g): Empty search state
**Test:**
1. Open the catalog again (tap "Add" button or "Browse catalog")
2. Tap the search box (testID=`explorer-search`)
3. Type a nonsense search term: "zzzxxxqqq123"
4. Wait for search results to update

**Screenshot:** `{size}_empty_search.png`

**Pass criteria:**
- ✅ Search executes (product grid updates)
- ✅ Zero results shown (no product cards)
- ✅ Friendly empty-state message appears (e.g., "No products match")
- ✅ NOT just blank white space
- ✅ Empty state has icon and helpful text

**Visual checks:**
- Is the empty state centered and well-designed?
- Does it suggest clearing filters or trying a different search?

### Checkpoint (h): Keyboard overlap
**Test:**
1. Close the catalog (if open)
2. Tap the discount area to open the discount sheet
3. Tap the discount percent input field to focus it
4. Observe if the on-screen keyboard appears (on mobile devices)

**Screenshot:** `{size}_keyboard_visible.png`

**Alternative test:**
1. Tap the customer notes field (testID=`quote-notes-input`)
2. Observe if the on-screen keyboard appears

**Screenshot:** `{size}_keyboard_notes.png`

**Pass criteria:**
- ✅ On-screen keyboard appears when input is focused
- ✅ Input field remains visible above the keyboard (NOT hidden)
- ✅ Confirm button (if any) remains visible above the keyboard
- ✅ View scrolls/adjusts automatically to keep focused field visible
- ✅ Can type into the field without the keyboard blocking it

**Visual checks:**
- Does the view scroll when keyboard appears?
- Is the input field at least 50% visible above the keyboard?
- Can you see what you're typing?

**Note:** This test is most relevant on actual mobile devices. In desktop browser DevTools, the on-screen keyboard won't appear, but you can verify the layout accommodates it by checking if there's adequate space below input fields.

## Known Tool Limitation
**Automated browser testing is currently blocked** due to a systematic string parsing error in the browser automation tool (mcp_browser_automation). This is a tool-level issue, not an application bug. The same error was encountered in the previous testing session (2026-07-16).

**Evidence:**
- Backend API is healthy and working correctly (verified via curl)
- Authentication endpoint returns valid JWT tokens
- Frontend code review shows correct implementation
- Previous testing agent confirmed this is a tool limitation

**Workaround:**
Manual testing is required until the browser automation tool is fixed or an alternative testing approach is implemented.

## Additional Notes

### Test Data
- Use real-looking customer names (not "Test Customer")
- Use actual products from the catalog (2601 products available)
- Verify calculations are mathematically correct

### Console Errors
- Open browser DevTools Console tab
- Watch for any red errors during testing
- Report any errors found with full stack trace

### Network Requests
- Open browser DevTools Network tab
- Watch for any failed API requests (4xx, 5xx)
- Report any failed requests with status code and endpoint

### Performance
- Note any slow loading times (>3 seconds)
- Note any janky scrolling or animations
- Note any unresponsive buttons (>1 second delay)
