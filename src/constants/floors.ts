// Canonical floor identifiers. Mirrors backend/services/floor_scope.py's
// DEFAULT_FLOORS and backend/auth.py's TILES_FLOOR_ID — these ids are the
// values stored in every scoped document's `floor_id` and sent as the
// `X-Floor-Id` request header (src/api/client.ts).
//
// Screens that belong to exactly one business unit must pin their requests
// to that unit's id rather than inheriting the global floor switcher's
// current selection: inheriting it is what let Tile Orders show Sanitary
// Bathroom records (and vice versa) whenever the selection was stale or
// unset.
