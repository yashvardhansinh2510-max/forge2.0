 * always says so in the same words and in the same place. The alternative —
 * each block inventing its own empty rendering — is how a page ends up
 * showing a blank card in one place and "₹0" in another for the identical
 * condition, leaving the owner unable to tell "nothing sold" from "failed to
 * load".
 *
 * `question` is the owner-facing question the block answers, kept on the
 * block itself rather than in documentation.
